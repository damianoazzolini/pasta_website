% Conditional
(fly(X) | bird(X))[0.6,1].

% The conditional is equivalent to
% 0{fly(X)}1:- bird(X).
% :- #count{X:fly(X),bird(X)} = FB, #count{X:bird(X)} = B, 10*FB < 6*B.

fly:- fly_w(1).

% Query: fly
% Expected: lower 0.7, upper 1.0
% That is, there are 2 worlds, 1 where fly(1) (the probabilistic
% fact) is true, the other where it is false
% The world with fly(1) contributes to both lower and upper 
% probability with 0.7
% For the other world, we need to consider the models: it has
% 5 and the query is true in 4 of them, so we have a contribution
% of 0.3 only to the upper probability.
% Overall: upper 0.7 + 0.3 = 1, lower = 0.7
